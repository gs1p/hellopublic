                The product data journey: digitalisation and standardisation
              </h4>
              <p>
                GS1 has a long history in retailâ€”and the ubiquitous "beep" of the GS1 barcode is heard at store checkouts over 10 billion times every day. Business need to ensure however, that the products they sell are as well represented in the digital world, as they are in the physical world.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is why GS1 is partnering with the retail industry to build a stronger product data foundation, based on unique product identity. Through services such as Verified by GS1, businesses can enjoy a consistent and reliable flow of information, making operations between retailers and brand owners more transparent.
