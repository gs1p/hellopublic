                        <h2>If you want to sell products on e-commerce sites or Marketplaces, you need a GTIN.</h2>
                        <p>
                            Marketplaces like Daraz, OLX Pakistan, Telemart, and Shophive benefit from having a GTIN, a Global Trade Item Number. Additionally, international platforms such as Amazon, Mercado Libre, Cdiscount, eMAG, and JD.com also find GTINs valuable for improving product visibility and inventory management.

                            A GTIN is a unique number that identifies your product as your own. It is the number found beneath the barcode on product packaging and is used when listing products online.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a GTIN issued by GS1*, you can list your products quickly and accurately, meeting marketplace requirements. Your GTIN is unique within the GS1 system, ensuring your product won't be confused with similar items. A GTIN also enhances the online visibility of your products.

                                The GS1 GTIN is a recognised international standard and is
                                accepted globally. Once you have a GS1 GTIN, you can use the same
                                number to expand your business seamlessly to other e-commerce
                                sites, online marketplaces and physical retail stores.
